Suppose you are given an unsorted array S of n integers. Solve each
of the following tasks below with the best possible algorithms that you 
can think of and analyze their time complexities. Let's assume the
following constraints: 1 <= n <= 100K, so that O(n^2) solutions
are theoratically infeasible in a contest environment

There are several ohter cool tricks possible with bit manipulations techniques
but these are rarely used. Please implement these tasks with bit manipulation

# For Question 2231.cpp

We can also use a reasizable array ( C++ STL vector or Java Vector ) to implement an
efficient stack. Figure out how to achieve this. Follow up question, Can we use a static
array, linked list, or a deque instead? Why or why not?

# For Questions 2241.cpp

We can use a linked list (C++ STL list of Java LinkedList) to implement an efficient
queue ( or deque ). Figure out how to achieve this. Follow up question: can we use a
reasizable array instead? Why or why not?
